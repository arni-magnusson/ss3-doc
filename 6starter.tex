SS begins by reading the file starter.ss.  Its format and content is as follows.  Note that the term COND in the Typical Value column means that the existence of input shown there is conditional on a value specified earlier in the file.  Omit or comment out these entries if the appropriate condition has not been selected.

Options 1 and 2 use total catch for the year and summary abundance at the beginning of the year, so combines seasons and areas.  But if most catch occurs in one area and there is little movement between areas, this ratio is not informative about the F in the area where the catch is occurring.  Option 3 is a simple sum of the full F’s by fleet, so may provide non-intuitive results when there are multi areas or seasons or when the selectivities by fleet do not have good overlap in age.  Option 4 is a real annual F calculated as a numbers weighted F for a specified range of ages (read below).  The F is calculated as Z-M where Z and M are each calculated an ln(N(t+1)/N(t)) with and without F active, respectively. The numbers are summed over all biology morphs and all areas for the beginning of the year, so subsumes any seasonal pattern.}}\\

\subsection{Jitter}
\hypertarget{Jitter}{}
The jitter factor is multiplied by a random normal deviation rdev = N(0,1) to a transformed parameter value based upon the predefined parameter bounds:
\begin{equation}
temp = -\frac{1}{2}rdev \times jitter \times ln(\frac{P_{MAX} - P_{MIN} + 0.0000002}{P_{VAL}-P_{MIN} + 0.0000001}-1)
\end{equation}
with the final jittered starting parameter value backtransformed as:
\begin{equation}
P_{NEW} = P_{MIN} + \frac{P_{MAX}-P_{MIN}}{1+e^{-2 \times temp}}
\end{equation}
