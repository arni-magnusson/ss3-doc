## Initial Numbers-at-Age

The population in the initial year of a SS application can be simply an unfished equilibrium population, a population in equilibrium with an estimated mortality rate that is influenced by data on historical equilibrium catch, or an equilibrium population that has estimable age-specific deviations from this equilibrium for a user-specified number of the younger ages.

The numbers of animals of gender $\gamma$ in age group a in a virgin state ($y=0$) is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn1}
N_{0,\gamma,a} =
\begin{cases}
cR_0e^{-aM_{\gamma,a}} & \text{for $a=0$ to $A-1$} \\
\sum_{a=A}^{3A-1}N_{0,\gamma,a} + \frac{N_{0,\gamma,3A-1}e^{-M_{\gamma,a}}}{1-e^{-M_{\gamma,a}}} & \text{for $a=A$ to $3A-1$}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $c$ (I)[^1] is a user-defined constant that determines the sex-ratio of recruits[^2], $M_{\gamma,a}$ (P)[^3] is natural mortality for age a and sex $\gamma$, $A$ is the plus-group age, $3A$ is three times the plusgroup age, and $R_0$ is the number of age-0 fish at unfished equilibrium. The plus group virgin
numbers-at-age calculation is based on 3 timex the maximum age to include movement dynamics through age $3A-1$. After calculating the numbers-at-age through age $3A$, the numbers are collapsed to age A for subsequent calculations. Equation \ref{eqn1} use total mortality, $Z_{\gamma,a}$ (see Equation 1.21 XX), rather than $M_{\gamma,a}$ when the initial equilibrium also involves fishing mortality. Although this fishing mortality will reduce spawning biomass, no adjustment to $R_0$ is made on premise that this reduction has probably not been occurring for enough years to effect this change. $R_0$ serves as both the starting level of mean recruitment and as the factor that scales the mean spawner-recruitment relationship against which future annual recruitment deviations will act. An estimated offset, $R_1$, can be applied to $R_0$. When the initial population involves agespecific deviations, these deviations are an extension of the zero-centered, lognormal recruitment deviations applied to the equilibrium numbers-at-age (see Equation 1.20 XX).

## Recruitment

The number of age-0 fish is related to spawning biomass according to a stock-recruitment relationship. A range of stock-recruitment relationships are available. Here, the Beverton-Holt is described:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn2}
R_y = \frac{4hR_0SB_y}{SB_0(1-h)+SB_y(5h-1)}e^{-0.5b_y\sigma_R^2+\tilde{R}_y} \;\ \tilde{R}_y \sim N(0; \sigma_R^2)
\end{equation}
