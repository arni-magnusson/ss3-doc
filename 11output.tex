\section{Output Files}
\subsection{Standard ADMB output files}
Standard ADMB files are created by SS.  These are:\\
\\
SS3.PAR – This file has the final parameter values.  They are listed in the order they are declared in SS.  This file can be read back into SS to restart a run with these values (see running SS).\\
\\
SS3.STD – This file has the parameter values and their estimated standard deviation for those parameters that were active during the model run.  It also contains the derived quantities declared as sdreport variables.  All of this information is also report in the covar.sso.  Also, the parameter section of report.sso lists all the parameters with their SS generated names, denotes which were active in the reported run, displays the parameter standard deviations, then displays the derived quantities with their standard deviations.\\
\\
SS3.REP – This report file is created between phases so, unlike report.sso, will be created even if the Hessian fails.  It does not contain as much output as shown in report.sso.\\
\\
SS3.COR – This is the standard ADMB report for parameter and sdreport correlations.  It is in matrix form and challenging to interpret.  This same information is reported in covar.sso.

\subsection{Derived Quantities}
Before listing the derived quantities reported to the sdreport, there are a couple of topics that deserve further explanation.

\subsubsection{Metric for Fishing Mortality}
A generic single metric of annual fishing mortality is difficult to define in a generalized model that admits multiple areas, multiple biological cohorts, dome-shaped selectivity in size and age for each of many fleets.  Several separate indices are provided and others could be calculated by a user from the detailed information in report.sso.

\subsubsection{Equilibrium SPR}
This index focuses on the effect of fishing on the spawning potential of the stock.  It is calculated as the ratio of the equilibrium reproductive output per recruit that would occur with the current year’s F intensities and biology, to the equilibrium reproductive output per recruit that would occur with the current year’s biology and no fishing.  Thus it internalizes all seasonality, movement, weird selectivity patterns, and other factors.  Because this index moves in the opposite direction than F intensity itself, it is usually reported as 1-SPR.  A benefit of this index is that it is a direct measure of common proxies used for F\textsubscript{MSY}, such as F\textsubscript {40\%}.  A shortcoming of this index is that it does not directly demonstrate the fraction of the stock that is caught each year.  The SPR value is also calculated in the benchmarks (see below).  The derived quantities report shows an annual SPR statistic.  The options, as specified in the starter.ss file, are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = skip
	\item 1 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{TGT})
	\item 2 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{MSY})
	\item 3 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{Btarget})
	\item 4 = raw SPR
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{F std}
This index provides a direct measure of fishing mortality.  The options are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = skip
	\item 1 = exploitation(Bio)
	\item 2 = exploitation(Num)
	\item 3 = sum(Frates)
\end{itemize}
The exploitation rates are calculated as the ratio of the total annual catch (in either biomass or numbers as specified) to the summary biomass or summary numbers on Jan 1.  The sum of the F rates is simply the sum of all the apical Fs.  This makes sense if the F method is in terms of instantaneous F (not Pope’s approximation) and if there are not fleets with widely different size/age at peak selectivity, and if there is no seasonality, and especially if there is only one area.  In the derived quantities, there is an annual statistic that is the ratio of the can be annual F\_std value to the corresponding benchmark statistic.  The available options for the denominator are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = raw
	\item 1 = F/F\textsubscript {SPR}
	\item 2 = F/F\textsubscript {MSY}
	\item 3 = F/F\textsubscript {Btarget}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{F-at-Age}
Because the annual F is so difficult to interpret as a sum of individual F components, an indirect calculation of F-at-age is reported at the end of the report.sso file.  This section of the report calculates Z-at-age simply as $ln(N_{a+1,t+1}/N_{a,t})$.  This is done on an annual basis and summed over all areas.  It is done once using the fishing intensities as estimated (to get Z), and once with the F intensities set to 0.0 to get M-at-age.  This latter sequence also provides a measure of dynamic Bzero.  The user can then subtract the table of M-at-age/year from the table of Z-at-age/year to get a table of F-at-age/year.  From this apical F, average F over a range of ages, or other user-desired statistics could be calculated.  Further work within SS with this table of values is anticipated.

\subsubsection{MSY and other Benchmark Items}
The following quantities are included in the sdreport vector mgmt\_quantities, so obtain estimates of variance.  Some additional quantities can be found in the benchmarks section of the forecast\_report.sso.

\subsection{Brief cumulative output}
Cum\_Report.sso:  contains a brief version of the run output, which is appended to current content of file so results of several runs can be collected together.  This is especially useful when a batch of runs is being processed.  Unless this file is deleted, it will contain a cumulative record of all runs done in that subdirectory.  The first column contains the run number.

\subsection{Bootstrap Data Files}
Data.ss\_new:  contains a user-specified number of data files, generated through a parametric bootstrap procedure, and written sequentially to this file.  These can be parsed into individual data files and re-run with the model.  The first output provides the unaltered input data file (with annotations added).  The second provides the expected values for only the data elements used in the model run.  The third and subsequent outputs provide parametric bootstraps around the expected values.

\subsection{Forecast and Reference Points}
FORECAST-REPORT.sso:  This file contains output of fishery reference points and forecasts.  It is designed to meet the needs of the Pacific Fishery Management Council’s Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, but it should be quite feasible to develop other regionally specific variants of this output.

The vector of forecast recruitment deviations is estimated during an additional model estimation phase.  This vector includes any years after the end of the recrdev time series and before or at the end year.  When this vector starts before the ending year of the time series, then the estimates of these recruitments will be influenced by the data in these final years.  This is problematic, because the original reason for not estimating these recruitments at the end of the time series was the poor signal/noise ratio in the available data.  It is not that these data are worse than data from earlier in the time series, but the low amount of data accumulated for each cohort allows an individual datum to dominate the model’s fit.  Thus, an additional control is provided so that forecast recruitment deviations during these years can receive an extra weighting in order to counter-balance the influence of noisy data at the end of the time series.

An additional control is provided for the fraction of the log-bias adjustment to apply to the forecast recruitments.  Recall that R is the expected mean level of recruitment for a particular year as specified by the spawner-recruitment curve and R’ is the geometric mean recruitment level calculated by discounting R with the log-bias correction factor e-0.5s\^2.  Thus a lognormal distribution of recruitment deviations centered on R’ will produce a mean level of recruitment equal to R.  During the modeled time series, the virgin recruitment level and any recruitments prior to the first year of recruitment deviations are set at the level of R, and the lognormal recruitment deviations are centered on the R’ level.  For the forecast recruitments, the fraction control can be set to 1.0 so that 100\% of the log-bias correction is applied and the forecast recruitment deviations will be based on the R’ level.  This is certainly the configuration to use when the model is in MCMC mode.   Setting the fraction to 0.0 during maximum likelihood forecasts would center the recruitment deviations, which all have a value of 0.0 in ML mode, on R.  Thus would provide a mean forecast that would be more comparable to the mean of the ensemble of forecasts produced in MCMC mode.  Further work on this topic is underway.\\
\\
Note:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cohorts continue growing according to their specific growth parameters in the forecast period rather than staying static at the endyr values.
	\item Environmental data entered for future years can be used to adjust expected recruitment levels.  However, environmental data will not affect growth or selectivity parameters in the forecast.
\end{itemize}

The top of this file shows the search for F\textsubscript {SPR}  and the search for F\textsubscript {MSY}  so the user can verify convergence.  Note:  if the STD file shows aberrant results, such as all the standard deviations being the same value for all recruitments, then check the F\textsubscript {MSY}  search for convergence. 

The F\textsubscript {MSY} can be calculated, or set equal to one of the other F reference points per the selection made in STARTER.SS.

The reference point output is shown int he table below: 
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{ManagementReport}
\end{center}


\begin{landscape}
	The forecast is done once using the Target SPR and once using the adjustments specified in the 40:10 section of forecast.ss input.  Each section contains a time series of seasonal biomass and catch, followed by a time series of population numbers-at-age for each morph.
	
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{Forecast}
	\end{center}
\end{landscape}

where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 40:10 is the magnitude of the adjustment of harvest multiplier to implement the OY policy
	\item bio-all is the biomass of all ages
	\item bio-smry is the biomass for ages at or above the summary age
	\item Spawnbio - is the female spawning output
	\item Depletion is the spawnbio divided by the unfished spawnbio
	\item Recruit-0 is the recruitment of age-o fish in this year
	\item Dead\_cat\_B-1 is the total dead (retained plus dead discard) catch in MT for fleet 1
	\item Retain\_B-1 is fleet 1’s retained catch in MT
	\item Equivalent catch in numbers is then reported.
	\item Hrate-1 is the harvest rate, as adjusted by the 40:10 policy.  The units will depend on the F method selected (Pope’s method giving mid-year harvest rate or the continuous F.
	\item Opt=C means that the rate was calculated from an input catch level (and crashed means that this caused an excessive harvest rate.
	\item Opt=R means that the catch was calculated from the target harvest rate.
	\item ABC is equal to the Total-Catch when the 40:10 option is not used (upper portion of table).  When the 40:10 is on (lower table), the ABC is the catch level corresponding to no 40:10 adjustment after accounting for catch in previous year’s from the 40:10.
\end{itemize}

The time series output described above is detailed by season, area, morph and fishery.  It is usually more convenient to have annual values summed across areas, morphs and fisheries.  This is done for the 40:10 output and a subset of these values are replicated in the depletion vector in the sd\_report so that variance estimates can be obtained.  The elements of the depletion vector in the sd\_report are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item depletion level in end year
	\item depletion level in end year+1
	\item MSY (if calculated, else spbio in endyr-1)
	\item BMSY (if calculated, else spbio in endyr)
	\item SPRMSY (if calculated, else spbio in endyr+1) then the time series of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spawning biomass
		\item Recruitment
		\item Depletion level
		\item Total catch (if forecast calculated catch from rates) or sum of fishery-specific harvest rates (if forecast is based on fixed input catch level in this year)
		\item Total exploitation rate (total dead catch divided by the summary biomass at the beginning of the year).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{HCR}\\
	Two examples of harvest forecast adjustment: one adjusts catch and the other adjusts F.
\end{center}

\subsection{Main Output File, report.sso}
This is the primary output file.  Its major sections are listed below.  

The sections of the output file are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SS version number with date compiled.  Time and date of model run.  This info appears at the top of all output files.
	\item Comments
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Input file lines starting with \#C are echoed here
		\end{itemize}
	\item Keywords
		\begin{itemize}
			\item List of keywords used in searching for output sections.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Fleet Names
		\begin{itemize}
			\item List of fishing fleet and survey names assigned in the data file
		\end{itemize}
	\item Likelihood
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Final values of the negative log(likelihood) are presented.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Input Variance Adjustments
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The matrix of input variance adjustments is output here because these values affect the logL calculations
		\end{itemize}
	\item Parameters
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The parameters are listed here.  For the estimated parameters, the display shows: Num (count of parameters), Label (as internally generated by SS), Value, Active\_Cnt, Phase, Min, Max, Init, Prior, Prior\_type, Prior\_SD, Prior\_Like, Parm\_StD (standard deviation of parameter as calculated from inverse Hessian), Status (e.g. near bound), Pr\_atMin (value of prior penalty if parameter was near bound), and  Pr\_atMin.  The Active\_Cnt entry is a count of the parameters in the same order they appear in the ss3.cor file.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Derived Quantities
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This section starts by showing the options selected from the starter.ss and forecast.ss input files:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item SPR ratio basis
					\item F report basis
					\item B ratio denominator
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Then the time series of output, with standard deviation of estimates, are produced with internally generated labels.  Note that these time series extend through the forecast era.  The order of the output is:  spawning biomass, recruitment, SPRratio, Fratio, Bratio, management quantities, forecast catch (as a target level), forecast catch as a limit level (OFL), Selex\_std, Grow\_std, NatAge\_std.  For the three “ratio” quantities, there is an additional column of output showing a Z-score calculation of the probability that the ratio differs from 1.0.  The “management quantities” section is designed to meet the terms of reference for west coast groundfish assessments; other formats could be made available upon request.  The std quantities at the end are set up according to specifications at the end of the control input file.  In some cases, a user may specify that no derived quantity output of a certain type be produced.  In those cases, SS substitutes a repeat output of the virgin spawning biomass so that vectors of null length are not created.

ADMB NOTE:  while vectors of null length are very useful for controlling optional model inputs, they cannot be used with current version of ADMB for sdreport quantities.

\begin{itemize}
	\item MGparm by year after adjustments
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the time series of Mgparms by year after adjustment by environmental links, blocks and deviations.
	\end{itemize}
	\item SELparm (size) by year after adjustments
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the size selectivity parameters, after adjustment, for each year in which a change occurs.
	\end{itemize}
	\item SELparm (age) by year after adjustments
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the age selectivity parameters, after adjustment, for each year in which a change occurs.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Recruitment Distribution
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the distribution of recruitment across growth patterns, genders, birthseasons, and areas in the endyr of the model.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Morph Indexing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the internal index values for various quantities.  It can be a useful reference for complex model setups.  The vocabulary is:  Bio\_Pattern refers to a collection of cohorts with the same defined growth and natural mortality parameters; Gender is the next main index.  If recruitment occurs in multiple seasons, then Birthseas is the index for that factor.  The index labeled “Morph” is used as a continuous index across all the other factor-specific indices.  If sub-morphs are used, they are nested within the Bio\_Pattern x Gender x Birthseas morphs.  However, some of the output tables use the column label “morph” as a continuous index across morphs and sub-morphs.  Note that there is no index here for area.  Each of the cohorts is distributed across areas and they retain their biological characteristics as they move among areas.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Size Freq Translation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the generalize size frequency approach is used, this block shows the translation probabilities between population length bins and the units of the defined size frequency method.  If the method uses body weight as the accumulator, then output is in corresponding units.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Movement
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows movement rate between areas in a multi-area model.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Exploitation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the time series of the selected F\_std unit and the F multiplier for each fleet in terms of harvest rate (if Pope’s approximation is used) or fully selected F.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Index 2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section reports the observed and expected values for each index.  All are reported in one list with index number included as a selection field.  At the bottom of this section, the root mean squared error of the fit to each index is compared to the mean input error level to assist the user in gaging the goodness-of-fit and potentially adjusting the input level of imprecision.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Index 3
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section shows the parameter number assigned to each parameter used in this section.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Discard
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the list of observed and expected values for the amount (or fraction) discard.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Mean Body Wt
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the list of observed and expected values for the mean body weight.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Fit Len Comps
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the list of the goodness of fit to the length compositions.  The input and output levels of effective sample size are shown as a guide to adjusting the input levels to better match the model’s ability to replicate these observations.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Fit Age Comps
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This has the same format as the length composition section.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Fit Size Comps
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This has the same format as the length composition section and is used for the generalized size composition summary.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Len Selex
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Here is the length selectivity and other length specific quantities for each fishery and survey.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Age Selex
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Here is reported the time series of age selectivity and other age-related quantities for each fishery and survey.  Some are directly computed in terms of age, and others are derived from the combination of a length-based factor and the distribution of size-at-age.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Environmental Data
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The input values of environmental data are echoed here.  In the future, the summary biomass in the previous year will be mirrored into environmental column –2 and that the age zero recruitment deviation into environmental column –1.  Once so mirrored, they may enable density-dependent effects on model parameters.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Numbers at Age
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The output (in thousands of fish) is shown for each cohort tracked in the model.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Numbers at Length
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The output is shown for each cohort tracked in the model.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Catch at Age
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The output is shown for each fleet.  It is not necessary to show by area because each fleet operates in only one area.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Biology
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The first biology section shows the length-specific quantities in the ending year of the time series only.  The derived quantity spawn is the product of female body weight, maturity and fecundity per weight.  The second section shows natural mortality.

		\item This section shows derived size-at-age and other quantities.  It is the basis for the Bio report page of the Excel output processor.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Mean Body Wt (begin)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section reports the time series of mean body weight for each morph.  Values shown are for the beginning of each season of each year.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Mean Size Timeseries
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section shows the time series of mean length-at-age for each morph.  At the bottom is the average mean size as the weighted average across all morphs for each gender.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Age Length Key
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is reported for the midpoint of each season in the ending year.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Age Age Key
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the calculated distribution of observed ages for each true age for each of the defined ageing keys.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Selectivity Database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section contains the selectivities organized as a database, rather than as a set of vectors.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Spawning Biomass Report 2, etc.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The section shows annual total spawning biomass, then numbers-at-age at the beginning of each year for each Bio\_Pattern and Gender as summed over sub-morphs and areas.  Then Z-at-age is reported simply as $ln(N_{t+1,a+1} N_{t,a})$.  Then the Report\_1 section loops back through the time series with all F values set to zero so that a dynamic Bzero, N-at-age, and M-at-age can be reported.  The difference between Report\_1 and Report\_2 can be used to create an aggregate F-at-age.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Composition Database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This section is reported to a separate file, compreport.sso, and contains the length composition, age composition, and mean size-at-age observed and expected values.  It is arranged in a database format, rather than an array of vectors.  Software to filter the output allows display of subsets of the database.
	\end{itemize}
